My team is comprised of well-rounded software engineers, but we fall into our own niches.Â I like to get a little creative, so I've picked up many front-end projects, altering the entire outlook of our product. I have developed a passion for UI/UX design and am continuing to find places where we can make improvements to our CRM. I also contribute to altering our back-end to implement new features and aide our customers with their CRM needs by providing technical support and developing solutions for any software bugs."

						"description":"I started working at LACRM on a rotational basis. While as a CRM Coach, I continued to develop my coding skills by on smaller-scale web development projects. Coordinating with our web designer, I took mock ups and brought them to reality. During this time, I also really familiarized myself with PHP and MySQL, as I altered our internally-used CMS and public facing site. Being on the support team allowed me to really understand our customer base and their software wants."

The fellowship aims to prepare individuals for careers in tech. I was proud to be part of the first class of fellows here, and by the end, I had drastically improved my coding skills, enough for me to seamlessly transition into a full-time role after rotating for a few months."
