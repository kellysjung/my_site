						"description":"LACRM is designed specifically for small businesses, and we pride ourselves in our support and care for our customers. Our software engineering team is comprised of well-rounded individuals, but we fall into our own niches. Most of what I do are front-end projects, altering the entire outlook of our product, especially as we are moving our legacy code to React. I have developed a passion for UI/UX design and am continuing to find places where we can make improvements to our CRM. I also contribute is altering our back-end to implement new features and aide our customers with their CRM needs by providing technical support and developing solutions for any software flaws."

						"years":"July 2018 - Dec 2018",
						"description":"Before joining the development team full-time, I started working at LACRM on a rotational basis. While as a CRM Coach, I continued to develop my coding skills by working part time on web development projects. Coordinating with our web designer, I took web mock ups and brought them to reality. During this time, I really familiarized myself with PHP and MySQL as I altered our internally-used CMS and public facing site. Being on the support team allowed me to really familiarize myself with the product I would soon come to work directly on and understand our customer base and their software wants."

						"title":"Coding Fellow",
						"years":"May 2017 - Aug 2017",
						"description":"LACRM Coding Fellowship aims to teach coding skills to people from underrepresented groups in tech in order to promote diversity in the industry. Prior to the fellowship, I did not think I would pursue a career in tech, but I still understood the importance of diversity, in that it drives for more creativity, smarter decision-making, and better innovation. So I was proud to be part of the first class of fellows here, and by the end, I had drastically improved my coding skills, enough for me to seamlessly transition into a full-time role after rotating for a few months."
